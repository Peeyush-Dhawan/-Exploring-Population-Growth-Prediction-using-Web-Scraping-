# -Exploring-Population-Growth-Prediction-using-Web-Scraping-
'''In my latest project, I scraped data from Wikipedia and Worldometers using Python's BeautifulSoup and analyzed it to predict future population growth for various countries over the next 10 years. This exercise not only improved my web scraping skills but also helped me implement predictive modeling.

Here's a brief overview of the process:

🌐 Web Scraping: Collected fertility rate and population data from Wikipedia and Worldometers using the requests library and BeautifulSoup for HTML parsing.
📊 Data Analysis: Cleaned and organized the data using pandas for further analysis.
🔮 Population Prediction: Applied growth rates to forecast population for the next decade, visualizing predictions for countries like China, India, and the USA.
📈 Visualization: Plotted the population trends using matplotlib for clear insights.'''
